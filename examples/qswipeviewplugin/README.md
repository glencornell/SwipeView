# Qt Designer UI Plugin

This directory creates the library to integrate the QSwipeView,
QPageIndicator and other widgets in this project with QtDesigner. This
plugin allows the UI designer to see and interact with the custom
widgets.  Without this library, the UI designer will only see a static
placeolder for the widget in the qtdesigner tool.

## Dependencies

This requires that you install the following packages:

```bash
sudo apt install designer-qt6 qt6-tools-dev qt6-tools-dev-tools
```
